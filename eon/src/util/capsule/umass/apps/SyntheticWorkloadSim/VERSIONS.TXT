v1.0 : Completely working synthetic workload generator parameters
       Leds not used to reduce power consumption
       Serial port debug pkts can be enabled / disabled using #define 
             - disabled by default
       Radio modelled as a state machine - turned off when not in use
       Supports micaz as of now - should run on mica2 also with radio change

       -> Processor sleep power mode not working - results in mote sleep 
          current much greater than should be the case
       -> Radio is on throughout the first "cycle" (upto the point it is 
          first used) and is turned off at the end of the cycle. After this
          it will be switched on/off correctly as application semantics.
          This is primarily because disabling the radio right at application
          starting time was giving an error.
v1.1 : Improved precision of processing cycles
v2.0 : Changed application to state machine
v2.1 : Added CC1000 synthetic workload generator for the mica2
v2.2 : Added radio busy check to state machine, to prevent simultaneous
       transmission related conflicts
v2.3 : Improved processing cycles computation
v2.4 : Can handle bigger numbers now - changed uint16s to uint32s
