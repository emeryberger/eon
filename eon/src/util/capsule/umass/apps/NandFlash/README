Description:

This is a simple application that provides a command line interface
over the serial port to read, write, and erase NAND flash.

Note that commands are not echoed. All hex values must be in upper
case. Commands are:

I      - initialize flash. (must be called first)
v XX   - set <data value> to XX
w XXXX - write 528 bytes <data value> to page XXXX
W XXXX - write incrementing values (starting at <data value>) to page XXXX
r XXXX - read page XXXX, verify that all bytes = <data value>
z XXX  - print bytes XXX to XXX+15 from last page read with 'r'
R XXXX - read page XXXX, print unique bytes
e XXXX - erase block containing page XXXX
i      - read flash ID code
