Energy management is a critical problem in designing mobile computing
systems, especially when those systems depend on harvesting energy
from environmental sources, such as solar or wind.  Environmental
sources are highly variable and difficult to predict, which is often
complicated further when nodes are mobile.  In this demo, we present a
simple approach for developing energy-aware applications using a
high-level data flow oriented coordination language.  This language,
eFlux, is an extension of the Flux~\cite{flux} coordination language,
which provides a simple interface for specifying an energy adaptation
policy, which can then be implemented automatically by the underlying
runtime system.  This approach allows a system designer to change the
underlying adaptation algorithms (e.g. energy source prediction)
without modifying the application.  Also, the data flow programming
style of Flux simplifies program profiling and performance prediction.

In this demo, we will present our experience, to date, using eFlux,
including both working system and simulation results.  We will
demonstrate an energy-aware GPS tracking device for tracking
threatened Wood Turtles in Western Massachusetts.  

The demo will require an easle for a poster and power.  Access to
sunlight would be beneficial, although it is not required.
